    <p> "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,
    and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad,
    wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by
    vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime." -Mark Twain

     I write about travel to convey both the complex challenges and
     beauties of humanity. I have always said that if we each had a friend from
     every country, there would be a lot less war, and so much more understanding.
     Governments are not people. People are more diverse, more empathic, and more
     vulnerable. You may dislike the policies of certain countries, but I guarantee
     that you could make a friend any country. Through this blog, I will introduce
     you to the friends I make traveling; then, hopefully, you can imagine making your own,
      imagine a more connected, more understanding world.
